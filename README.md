# Curses Multi Select Menu
curses menu for selecting multiple elements and then returning row elements as an array of unmodified strings.

## Testing & Install
run `gem build curses_multi_select_menu.gemspec` and `gem install curses_multi_select_menu-0.0.1.gem` or whatever the gem is called after building it.

## TODO
1. add method which works on line-label/line-value pairs, so that we can display the line-label in the multi-select
menu and then return the line-value later on.
2. submit results with keypress "o"
